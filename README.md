## Course Description

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks for exercises and assignments from the IBM Professional Certificate in Machine Learning course. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the techniques and tools used in the field of machine learning.

**Key Elements of the Course**

- **Fundamentals of Machine Learning**: Understanding basic concepts and terminology in machine learning.
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Exploration of algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
- **Unsupervised Learning Models**: Learning about clustering, dimensionality reduction, and techniques like K-means and PCA.
- **Deep Learning**: Introduction to deep neural networks, architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- **Model Evaluation**: Methods for assessing the accuracy and effectiveness of models, including cross-validation.
- **Practical Implementation**: Application of techniques in real-world projects using tools like Python and popular libraries (pandas, scikit-learn).
- **Ethics in Machine Learning**: Discussion on ethics and responsibility in the use of machine learning models.
